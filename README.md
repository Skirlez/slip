# Simple LoggIng Program (SLIP)
This is an incredibly simple program to receive logs from two projects of mine: [Void Stranger Endless Void](https://github.com/skirlez/void-stranger-endless-void), and [Nubby's Forgery](https://github.com/Skirlez/nubbys-forgery).

All it does is listen for UDP packets coming from localhost to a port, and spits out whatever it is given.

## Usage
`./slip` (uses port 1235)

`./slip [port]`

## Building
`cargo build [--release]`
